# Roles

The `postgres` user is created automatically when install PostgreSQL. This user is the superuser for the PostgreSQL instance and it is equivalent to the MySQL root urser.

It is good practice to create a role that has the `CREATEDB` and `CREATEROLE` privileges, but is not a superuser, and then use this role for all routine management of databases and roles. This approach avoids the dangers of operating as a superuser for tasks that do not really require it.

### Connect Postgres first time with superuser `postgres`

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

It is convenient to create a role name that match operating system user name to get the authentication with peer method, `jl` as example.

### Create Role `jl` with `LOGIN`, `CREATEDB`, `CREATEROLE` privileges

```sql
CREATE ROLE jl LOGIN CREATEDB CREATEROLE;
```

### Exit superuser

```sql
\q
```

### Connect database `postgres` with new created user `jl`

```bash
# psql -U jl -d postgres
psql postgres
```

### Create a database with the same name as login user

```sql
CREATE DATABASE jl;

\q
```

### Now connect database `jl` with user `jl`

```bash
psql
```
