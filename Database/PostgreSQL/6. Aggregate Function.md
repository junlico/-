### Using https://mockaroo.com/ to add new table

Table Name: car

| Field Name | Type       |

Download in `SQL` format and change table as below

```sql
CREATE TABLE car (
	id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL,
	make VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	model VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
	price NUMERIC(19, 2) NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
\i /home/jl/Downloads/car.sql
```

### MIN, MAX, AVG

```sql
SELECT MAX(price) FROM car;
SELECT MIN(price) FROM car;
SELECT AVG(price) FROM car;
SELECT ROUND(AVG(price)) FROM car;
```

```sql
SELECT make, MAX(price) FROM car GROUP BY make;

SELECT make, MIN(price), MAX(price), ROUND(AVG(price), 2) FROM car GROUP BY make;
```

### SUM

```sql
SELECT SUM(price) FROM car;

SELECT make, COUNT(*), SUM(price)  FROM car GROUP BY make ORDER BY SUM(price) DESC;
```

### Arithmetic Operators

```sql
SELECT id, make, model, price AS original_price, ROUND(price * .1, 2) AS discount, ROUND(price * .9, 2) AS discount_price FROM car;
```

### COALESCE

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(1) AS number;
SELECT COALESCE(null, 1) as number;
SELECT COALESCE(null, null, 1) as number;
SELECT COALESCE(null, null, 1, 10) as number;
```

```sql
SELECT email FROM person;
SELECT COALESCE(email, 'Email not provided') FROM person;
```

### NULLIF

Handle division by 0

```sql
SELECT 10 / 0;

SELECT NULLIF(10, 10);
SELECT NULLIF(10, 1);

SELECT 10 / NULL;
SELECT 10 / NULLIF(0, 0);

SELECT COALESCE(10 / NULLIF(0, 0), 0);
```

### DATE

```sql
SELECT NOW();

SELECT NOW()::DATE;

SELECT NOW()::TIME;

SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '1 YEAR';
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 YEARS';
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 MONTHS';
SELECT (NOW() + INTERVAL '10 MONTHS')::DATE;
```

### Extract

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT (YEAR FROM NOW());
SELECT EXTRACT (MONTH FROM NOW());
SELECT EXTRACT (DAY FROM NOW());
-- day of week
SELECT EXTRACT (DOW FROM NOW());
SELECT EXTRACT (CENTURY FROM NOW());
```

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, gender, country_of_birth, date_of_birth, AGE(date_of_birth) AS age FROM person;
```
